# Zero-Inflated Poisson INGARCH Model for Earthquake Prediction

## Introduction

This repository contains the R scripts and data for the implementation and evaluation of an innovative Zero-Inflated Poisson Integer-Valued Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ZIP-INGARCH) model designed for analyzing and predicting the monthly frequency of earthquakes with a magnitude above 5.

## Project Abstract

Earthquakes are natural disasters with the potential to impact millions globally. Analyzing earthquake data is paramount to understanding seismic mechanisms and enhancing public safety. This project adopts the ZIP-INGARCH model to address the discrete, sporadic, and zero-inflated nature of major earthquake data. The Bayesian approach, leveraging a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, is employed for parameter estimation.

Various orders of ZIP-INGARCH models are fitted to the data, with subsequent one-step-ahead point and interval predictions made for earthquake occurrences. Predictive accuracy is assessed using the Average Absolute Error and the Average Relative Error metrics. The ZIP-INGARCH(2,2) model demonstrates superior performance, with the median of its predictive distribution achieving an Average Absolute Error of 0.125 and an Average Relative Error of 0.0625. Additionally, the prediction intervals for all models reliably encompass the actual observed values, affirming the precision of the proposed forecasting method.
