# Earthquake-Forcasting-BayesML
 Advanced seismic activity analysis and prediction using Bayesian statistics and machine learning techniques. This repository showcases a comprehensive approach to modeling and forecasting earthquake occurrences, employing the Zero-Inflated Poisson Integer-Valued GARCH (ZIP-INGARCH) model, leveraging Bayesian inference for parameter estimation, and utilizing machine learning for enhanced predictive accuracy. The content demonstrates robust methods to tackle the challenges of discrete, infrequent, and zero-inflated seismic data, aiming to contribute to earthquake preparedness and risk mitigation.
